<h1>
    JGuiD User Guide<u> </u>
</h1>
<p>
     JFrame is the default and only option.
</p>
<p>
     You may begin a new project or open an existing project file
</p>
<p>
     Here we have menubar, toolbox, user screen, and properties window.
</p>
<p>
     The JGuiD toolbox provides users with all of the available SWING
    components
</p>
<p>
     Toolbox allows users to select required components to be added to the
    user panel by clicking on it.
</p>
<p>
     Components can be moved by dragging with mouse on the user panel.
</p>
<p>
     Components can be resized by dragging at the right-bottom corner of the
    component.
</p>
<p>
     User can also resize the user panel if it is set Resizable.
</p>
<p>
     The properties window has two tabs. One contains the properties panel of
    the JFrame, and the other is the properties panel for the currently
    selected component on the user panel.
</p>
<p>
     The code screen shows the generated java code for the current user screen
    layout.
